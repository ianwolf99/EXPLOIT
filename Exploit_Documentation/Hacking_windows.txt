*Windows remains the most popular desktop operating system

NETBIOS Name Services
+when windows need to resolve ip address of a hostname,the lookup order is as follows
1)The local file at
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
2)DNS,first via local cache and then via the DNS server
3)The NetBIOS name service(NBNS) first via Link Local Multicast Name Resolution(LLMNR) queries and the via NetBIOS Name service(NetBIOS-NS)

[+] Windows sends broadcast queries ton the local subnets broadcast address via LLMNR and NetBIOS,which provides an opportunity for one to respond with a spoofed response

*Research to use via Metasploit
+use auxiliary/spoof/nbns/nbns_response
pairing with
+use auxiliary/server/capture_smb for authenication hashes
*Conduct pass-the-hash attack

Ports used by NetBIOS

Port/Protocol     Service
135/TCP           MS-RPC endpoint matter
137/UDP           NetBIOS name service
138/UDP           NetBIOS datagram service
139/TCP           NetBIOS session service
445/TCP           SMB

captured hashes can be used for pass-the-hash attacks

Responder is powerfull tool when exploiting NetBIOS and LLMNR response

*ability toprovide downloads tha include shells(exe and also HTML)

Responder would capture hashes when an authenication attemp is made

Windows Net Commands
+Exploring windows domains is alot more easier with commands

net view /domain->lists the hosts in the current domain

net accounts /domain->shows the domains password policy

net user /domain-> lists the users in a domain

net group /domain -> lists groups in a domain

net group "Domain Admins" /domain

net share->shows current smb shares
net session->used to review smb sessions

Powersploit is a set of powerful windows powershell scripts

Run a http server inside powersploits 
python -m SimpleHTTPServer and then an existing meterpreter shell

+Modern Windows systems running windows 7 and later use Windows remote Management(WinRM)

+Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
