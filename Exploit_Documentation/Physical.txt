*Physical access to systems, networks, and facilities can provide opportunities that remote
network attacks can’t. In most cases, direct physical access is one of the best ways to gain
higher-level access, making physical penetration tests a powerful tool
*One of the easiest ways into a facility is to accompany a legitimate employee. If you look
like you belong in the facility, and the organization is one in which not all employees know
each other, piggybacking is a good option. Piggybacking attacks rely on following employees in through secured doors or other entrances.
*While piggybacking can be a useful solution, other related techniques include dressing
as a delivery driver and bringing a box or other delivery in or finding another likely reason
to be admitted by employees

*Push-button locks, electronic keypads,
and other mechanisms may be used, and gaining access can be as simple as watching for a
legitimate user to punch in their code in plain sight!
*RFID and magnetic stripe access card systems and cloning tools
*Very high-security locations may even reinforce their fences with aircraft cable to
prevent vehicles from crashing through them and may extend their fences below ground level
to discourage digging under them
*Learning who is allowed through the gates, what sort of identification is
required, and if there are patrols, and what their schedules and habits are, should be part of
your penetration test documentation if they are in scope and exist at your target location
