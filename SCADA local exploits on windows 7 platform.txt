[+]exploit/windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator:
  This module exploits the Task Scheduler 2.0 XML 0day exploited by 
  Stuxnet. When processing task files, the Windows Task Scheduler only 
  uses a CRC32 checksum to validate that the file has not been 
  tampered with. Also, In a default configuration, normal users can 
  read and write the task files that they have created. By modifying 
  the task file and creating a CRC32 collision, an attacker can 
  execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. NOTE: Thanks to 
  webDEViL for the information about disable/enable.
[+]exploit/windows/local/ms13_053_schlamperei:
  This module leverages a kernel pool overflow in Win32k which allows 
  local privilege escalation. The kernel shellcode nulls the ACL for 
  the winlogon.exe process (a SYSTEM process). This allows any 
  unprivileged process to freely migrate to winlogon.exe, achieving 
  privilege escalation. This exploit was used in pwn2own 2013 by MWR 
  to break out of chrome's sandbox. NOTE: when a meterpreter session 
  started by this exploit exits, winlogin.exe is likely to crash.
[+]exploit/windows/local/ms13_081_track_popup_menu:
  This module exploits a vulnerability in win32k.sys where under 
  specific conditions TrackPopupMenuEx will pass a NULL pointer to the 
  MNEndMenuState procedure. This module has been tested successfully 
  on Windows 7 SP0 and Windows 7 SP1.
[+]exploit/windows/local/ms14_058_track_popup_menu:
  This module exploits a NULL Pointer Dereference in win32k.sys, the 
  vulnerability can be triggered through the use of TrackPopupMenu. 
  Under special conditions, the NULL pointer dereference can be abused 
  on xxxSendMessageTimeout to achieve arbitrary code execution. This 
  module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3, Windows 2003 
  SP2, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 2008 32bits. Also on Windows 7 SP1 
  and Windows 2008 R2 SP1 64 bits.
[+]exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image:
  This module exploits improper object handling in the win32k.sys 
  kernel mode driver. This module has been tested on vulnerable builds 
  of Windows 7 x64 and x86, and Windows 2008 R2 SP1 x64.
[+]exploit/windows/local/ms16_075_reflection:
  Module utilizes the Net-NTLMv2 reflection between DCOM/RPC to 
  achieve a SYSTEM handle for elevation of privilege. Currently the 
  module does not spawn as SYSTEM, however once achieving a shell, one 
  can easily use incognito to impersonate the token.
[+]exploit/windows/local/ppr_flatten_rec:
  This module exploits a vulnerability on EPATHOBJ::pprFlattenRec due 
  to the usage of uninitialized data which allows to corrupt memory. 
  At the moment, the module has been tested successfully on Windows XP 
  SP3, Windows 2003 SP1, and Windows 7 SP1.
