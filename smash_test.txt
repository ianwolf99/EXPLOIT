It is a wonderful tool for exploits because of the way it allows us to create an arbitrary sized array that contains pointers we control. It also saves the content on the heap, so that means you can use this to make heap allocations, something you already have seen in the information leak examples.

Borrowing this idea, we could come up with a strategy like this:

    Create an object.
    Similar to the leak setup, allocate some chunks no more than 18 (to avoid LFH).
    Free one of the chunks (somewhere between the 2nd or the 16th)
    Create 10 vectors. Each is filled with pointers to the same object. You may need to play with the size to figure out exactly how big the vectors should be. Hopefully, the content from one of the vectors will take over the freed chunk.
    Overflow the chunk that's found before the freed one.
    Use the object that the vector holds.
